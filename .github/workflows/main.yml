The contents of the updated ".github/workflows/main.yml" file will depend on the specific problem identified in the error logs. Since the error logs are not provided, I will provide a general template for a GitHub Actions workflow file:

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest

This is a basic template for a GitHub Actions workflow file that sets up a Python environment, installs dependencies, and runs tests using pytest. You will need to modify this template based on the specific requirements of your project.

Remember to replace "requirements.txt" with the correct file name if your project uses a different dependency file.
